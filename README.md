The 4 files uploaded do different things:

ArrowChanger changes the display arrows on the screen telling the user which way to move their hand

FindPose just tells me where the tracked image is and if it has moved in the left or right direction

SceneChange changes the scene from the home screen to the play screen

ScoreDisplay updates the scoreboard, a point is added each time the object is moved left or right or up and down.
